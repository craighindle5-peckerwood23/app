<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a full-stack application named FileSolved. Initially, it was a platform for customers to upload documents, select a service (like PDF conversion, OCR), pay via PayPal, and receive processed files via email.

However, the project has undergone two major pivots:
1.  **Tech Stack:** A mandatory migration of the entire backend from Python/FastAPI to Node.js/Express.js.
2.  **Brand & Purpose:** A complete rebranding from a generic file tool to a public empowerment platform. The new vision is to provide tools for everyday people to document disputes (with landlords, agencies, etc.), organize evidence, and generate structured complaints and reports.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
- **Frontend:** React SPA, redesigned to reflect the public empowerment platform mission.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express.js serving a REST API.
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Core Features:** Dynamic service/bundle display, file upload, order creation, payment processing (PayPal Live), and automated email notifications (Resend).
- **Core Content:** The user has provided extensive copy, branding guidelines, and a new list of 54 services focused on evidence-building and grievance documentation. This includes Bundle Packs for specific disputes (e.g., Landlord Protection, Officer Misconduct).
- **SEO:** Extensive SEO content, sitemaps, and schemas have been generated and need to be implemented.
- **AI Assistant:** A floating UI element to guide users, which has been designed and implemented visually.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a fully functional full-stack platform.
- **Backend:** The Node.js/Express.js backend is complete and operational. It serves all API endpoints for services, orders, user authentication, payments, and file uploads. It is successfully integrated with MongoDB, PayPal (Live), and Resend.
- **Frontend:** The React frontend has been completely redesigned to match the new public empowerment branding. The new homepage is implemented with all the user-specified sections, copy, and imagery. The navigation has been updated, and a functional (UI-only) floating AI assistant has been added. The  page dynamically fetches and displays all 54 services from the new backend.
- **Integrations:** PayPal (Live mode) and Resend (for email notifications) are fully configured with user-provided API keys and are working.
- **SEO/Content:** A comprehensive set of SEO documents has been generated and saved to the  and  directories. This includes sitemaps (), JSON-LD schemas, internal linking architecture, and HTML templates for all 54 service pages.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Generating a large set of SEO-related documents and innovation ideas based on a series of user prompts. This included sitemaps, HTML/JSON-LD content for services, internal linking architecture, and a list of future service ideas.
    - Status: FINISHED
    - Agent Testing Done: N/A
    - Which testing method agent to use? NA
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  Issue 1:  Frontend service catalog is out of sync (P1)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: None. The agent updated the backend catalog () but noted it still needed to update the frontend equivalent () and never did.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. View .
        2. Overwrite  with a TypeScript version of the new catalog to ensure type safety and consistency for any frontend components that might use this static file directly.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? While most of the site fetches dynamically, any component relying on the static TS catalog will have outdated information. This ensures full consistency across the stack.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
Upcoming Tasks:
- **P0: Implement Dynamic Service & Bundle Pages:** The most critical next step is to use the generated SEO content and templates () to build out the application's content.
    - Create a dynamic route in React Router (e.g., ).
    - Create a  component that fetches service details from the API and dynamically renders the title, description, FAQs, etc., based on the generated templates.
    - Implement similar dynamic pages for the Bundles and Categories.
- **P1: Implement Internal Linking Strategy:** Use the generated  as a guide to add internal links within the new service pages, category pages, and footer.
- **P2: Connect AI Assistant to a Backend:** The AI assistant is currently a UI-only component. The next step would be to build a backend route (e.g., ) and integrate it with an LLM to make it functional.

Future Tasks:
- Implement the new service/tool ideas from .
- Build the Admin Dashboard for monitoring orders and revenue.
- Implement the Profitability Engine and Bulk Processing features as per the original PRD.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - Issue 1: Image Placement Confusion
     - Debug checklist: This issue recurred multiple times. The agent was confused by misleading filenames and user instructions. It was finally resolved by using the  to identify the images correctly and renaming the files logically.
     - Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this? This is resolved, but the next agent should be aware that  is the hero image and  is the icon for the AI button and header.
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: Frontend
     - Is recurring issue? Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Axios
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Payments:** PayPal REST API (Live Mode)
- **Email:** Resend
- **Architecture:** Catalog-Driven Design, REST API

**key DB schema**
  - **Order**: 
  - **User**: 
  - These are defined via Mongoose schemas in the  directory.

**changes in tech stack**
  - The migration from **Python/FastAPI to Node.js/Express.js** is complete and validated.
  - **Resend** has been added for transactional emails.

**All files of reference**
- ✅ Connected to MongoDB: A clever workaround to run the Node.js app using the read-only supervisor config that expects a Python file.
- : The source of truth for all 54 services.
- : The completely redesigned homepage component.
- : Contains the updated condensed navigation and footer.
- : The new floating AI assistant component.
- : Now contains live keys for PayPal and Resend.
- : This new directory contains all the generated SEO and content planning documents, which are critical for the next phase of development.
-  and : The generated sitemaps for SEO.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The out-of-sync frontend service catalog () should be updated.

**key api endpoints**
- : Fetches all services from the new catalog.
- : Creates an order and sends a confirmation email.
- : Creates a PayPal order using Live credentials.
- : Captures the payment and sends a receipt email.
- User auth endpoints: , .

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The Platform's Mission Has Changed:** You are no longer building a simple file conversion tool. You are building a public empowerment platform. All future development should align with this mission. The user's prompts in messages #85 and #88 are your new source of truth for branding and tone.
- **SEO Implementation is the Next Step:** A large amount of SEO content and structure has been *generated* but not *implemented*. Your next major task is to create the dynamic pages and linking structure based on the files in the  directory.
- **Credentials are Live:** The  file contains working LIVE keys for PayPal and a working key for Resend. No need to ask the user for them again.
- **Image Confusion Resolved:** The image placement issue was a major recurring problem. It is now fixed. To be clear: the man at desk image is the hero background, and the FS neon logo is the icon for the header and the floating AI button. Do not change this unless explicitly instructed.
- **Frontend Catalog is Stale:** The file  is out of sync with the backend. This should be fixed to prevent potential inconsistencies.
